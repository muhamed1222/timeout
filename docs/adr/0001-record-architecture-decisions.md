# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:
- Provide historical context for future team members
- Document the reasoning behind important technical choices
- Enable better decision-making by learning from past choices
- Avoid repeating discussions about already-decided topics

Without documented decisions, team members often:
- Re-debate settled issues
- Make inconsistent choices
- Struggle to understand why certain patterns exist
- Waste time searching for context

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard in his article.

Each ADR will:
- Be numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Be stored in `docs/adr/`
- Follow a consistent format (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences)
- Be written in Markdown
- Be kept in version control

ADRs will be created for:
- Major technology choices
- Architectural patterns
- Infrastructure decisions
- Security approaches
- Performance strategies

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Historical Record**: Clear documentation of why decisions were made
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the architecture
- **Communication**: Decisions are communicated clearly and permanently
- **Learning**: We can review past decisions and learn from outcomes
- **Consistency**: Encourages consistent decision-making patterns

### Negative

- **Overhead**: Takes time to write and maintain ADRs
- **Discipline**: Requires team discipline to keep updated
- **Initial Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn the ADR format
- **Potential Bloat**: Too many trivial ADRs can create noise

### Mitigation

- Keep ADRs focused on significant decisions only
- Use a simple, consistent template
- Make writing ADRs part of the development process
- Review ADRs during code reviews
- Archive superseded ADRs rather than deleting them
