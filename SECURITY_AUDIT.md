# Security Audit Report

## Summary

This document tracks security vulnerabilities in dependencies and mitigation strategies.

## Current Vulnerabilities (as of latest audit)

### High Severity

1. **path-to-regexp (4.0.0 - 6.2.2)**
   - Issue: Backtracking regular expressions leading to ReDoS
   - Source: `@vercel/node` transitive dependency
   - Mitigation: Using `overrides` to force version `^7.0.0`
   - Status: ✅ Mitigated via package.json overrides

### Moderate Severity

1. **esbuild (<=0.24.2)**
   - Issue: Development server allows any website to send requests and read responses
   - Source: Multiple packages (`@vercel/node`, `vite`, `drizzle-kit` via `@esbuild-kit/esm-loader`)
   - Mitigation: Using `overrides` to force version `^0.25.11`
   - Note: Only affects development mode, not production
   - Status: ✅ Mitigated via package.json overrides

2. **undici (<=5.28.5)**
   - Issue: Insufficiently random values and DoS via bad certificate data
   - Source: `@vercel/node` transitive dependency
   - Mitigation: Using `overrides` to force version `^6.19.8`
   - Status: ✅ Mitigated via package.json overrides

## Remaining Risks

### Transitive Dependencies

Some vulnerabilities remain in transitive dependencies that cannot be easily overridden:

- `drizzle-kit` uses `@esbuild-kit/esm-loader` which has vulnerable `esbuild`
  - This only affects development tools, not production code
  - Monitor for updates to `drizzle-kit` that address this

- `vite` internal `esbuild` version
  - Only affects development/build time
  - Will be resolved when `vite` updates internally

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Run `npm audit` weekly and update dependencies
2. **Pin Critical Dependencies**: Consider using exact versions for security-critical packages
3. **Monitor Advisories**: Subscribe to GitHub security advisories for key dependencies
4. **Automated Scanning**: Consider integrating Dependabot or Snyk for automated vulnerability scanning

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check current vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Force fix (use with caution)
npm audit fix --force
```

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly**: Review `npm audit` output
- **Monthly**: Update patch and minor versions
- **Quarterly**: Review major version updates
- **On Advisory**: Immediate review and update if critical

## Notes

- `@vercel/node` is required for Vercel deployments
- Development-only vulnerabilities (esbuild in dev tools) are lower priority
- Production code should not be affected by most of these issues
- All mitigations are tracked in `package.json` `overrides` section
